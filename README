Welcome to Apache Wookie
=========================
Apache Wookie is a Java server application that allows you to upload and deploy 
widgets for your applications; widgets can not only include all the usual kinds 
of mini-applications, badges, and gadgets, but also fully-collaborative applications 
such as chats, quizzes, and games. 

Wookie is based on the W3C Widgets specification, but widgets can also be included 
that use extended APIs such as Google Wave Gadgets and OpenSocial. 

Administrators can upload Widgets packaged according to the W3C Widgets specification,
and makes these available to applications using a REST API. Applications typically have 
a plugin that implements this REST API, and enables users to pick widgets from a gallery 
of those available to add to their pages.
 
There is a Connector Framework included in Wookie for many different programming 
languages that simplifies the process of writing plugins.

Incubation Disclaimer
=====================
Apache Wookie is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software 
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator PMC. 

Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review 
indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process 
have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 

While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or 
stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully 
endorsed by the ASF.

Getting Started
===============
For a source distribution, please read BUILDING for 
instructions on building Apache Wookie. 

Apache Wookie is made available in a standalone binary distribution,
which means that once you download it, you should be able to run wookie
'out of the box' without having to download and configure any other components
	* Please read STANDALONE_BUILD_NOTES for this
	
Additionally a WAR archive binary distribution is also made available for Wookie. 
This is designed for users who wish to use/integrate Wookie into their existing server 
environment - an existing Tomcat instance for example.
	* Please read WAR_BUILD_NOTES for this
	
You may also want to refer to RELEASE_NOTES for the list of changes in this release; this
also contains information about any known issues.
