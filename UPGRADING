This document details any special actions that need to be taken when upgrading Wookie from a previous version. For
general information on new features and improvements, see NEW_AND_NOTEWORTHY.

FROM 0.9.1 TO 0.9.2
===================

A number of changes to the data model were put in place in 0.9.2, meaning that any existing databases must be updated.

Scripts for migrating databases to 0.9.2 can be found in /scripts/migration.

From 0.9.2, proxy policies are handled in a /policies text file rather than in the database; you should add your
previous policies to the /policies file in the new format. The new file covers both widget-access policies and whitelist
entries; the latter have a wildcard scope (*). For more information, see NEW_AND_NOTEWORTHY and see the documentation
included in the default policies file.

FROM 0.9.0 TO 0.9.1
===================

A number of changes to the data model were put in place in 0.9.1, meaning that any existing databases must be updated.

Scripts for migrating databases to 0.9.1 can be found in /scripts/migration.

From 0.9.1 the JCR persistence mechanism is an optional module that must be built separately; any installations using 
JCR will need to upgrade using a source release, building the modules/jcr subproject.
