Known Issues
============	

	* WOOKIE-222 - There is a known issue when using Tomcat 7.* with Wookie. Sometimes when a widget is actually 
	loaded, a browser alert box sometimes appears informing the user of a "Session Error". 
					 
    This is caused by the DWR library used by Wookie for Comet-based widgets handling HTTP-only cookies incorrectly; 
    Tomcat 7 uses HTTP-only cookies as the default setting to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
					 
    A workaround is to add the following to the WEB-INF/web.xml file
					 
    <init-param>
        <param-name>crossDomainSessionSecurity</param-name>
        <param-value>false</param-value>
    </init-param>
					
    Note that XSS prevention will still be in place in Tomcat 7; this just disables the additional mechanism
    implemented in DWR that conflicts with it.
 
    This is an issue for DWR 2.* with Tomcat 7.* (or earlier versions of Tomcat where useHttpOnly="true" is set.)
