Known Issues
============	

	* [WOOKIE-222] - There is a known issue when using Tomcat 7.* with Wookie. Sometimes when a widget is actually
					 loaded, a browser alert box sometimes appears informing the user of a "Session Error". 
					 
					 This is caused by the DWR library used by Wookie for Comet-based widgets handling HTTP-only cookies incorrectly; 
					 Tomcat 7 uses HTTP-only cookies as the default setting to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
					 
					 A workaround is to add the following to the WEB-INF/web.xml file
					 
					 <init-param>
						<param-name>crossDomainSessionSecurity</param-name>
						<param-value>false</param-value>
					</init-param>
					
					Note that XSS prevention will still be in place in Tomcat 7; this just disables the additional mechanism
					implemented in DWR that conflicts with it.
					 			
					This is an issue for DWR 2.* with Tomcat 7.* (or earlier versions of Tomcat where useHttpOnly="true" is set.)
