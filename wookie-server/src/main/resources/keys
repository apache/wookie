##
## API Keys File
##
## This file is dynamically loaded by Wookie and configures
## API keys for accessing Wookie. Each application that will
## interact with the Wookie REST API will need its own key
## and secret
## 
## The format of entries is key = secret
##
## The key is sent over plaintext in API requests, however
## the secret is only shared once with the application
## and then used privately to generate secure hashes.
##
## If a secret is compromised, it can be changed here without
## affecting existing data.
##
## Example:
##
## mykey = somerandomvalue
