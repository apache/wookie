This is an experimental Admin user interface based on widgets rather than using JSPs. 
It also uses a "progressive enhancement" approach that works on mobile.

To try it out just start wookie then run "ant" in this directory.

Visit now visit the UI at http://localhost:8080/wookie/admin/admin-ui/wookie.html. You will
be asked for the admin username and password, by default this is "java" and "java".

If you want to use a different URL for wookie then one or more of the following to your 
local.build.properties file:

wookie.domain=foo.org
wookie.port=8080
wookie.path=path_to_wookie/
