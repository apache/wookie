    <title>What does it look like?</title>
    <body>
        The grape you are assessing may be of a spherical or tubular type. 
        It is easiest to assess the general shape by holding the grape in 
        the palm of your hand and looking directly down on it
        (<todo_item type="TOREAD" href="note1">Eric Holland - How to assess grapes' shapes</todo_item>).

<question id='b'>
    <title>Spherical grape aroma</title>
    <body>
        Spherical grapes will tend to have a very light aroma
        (<todo_item type="TOREAD" href="http://www.TariqAziz.com/sniffit">Tariq Aziz – Words for describing grape aromas</todo_item>)
        It can help to bruise the grape slightly by gently squeezing it 
        (<todo_item type="TOREAD" href="http://www.TariqAziz.com/bruiseit">Tariq Aziz – Bruising grapes without destroying them</todo_item>
        on the vine for a fuller picture of its productive profile

<question id='c'>
    <title>Spherical grape aroma</title>
    <body>
        Tubular grapes will tend to have a robust aroma
        (<todo_item type="TOREAD" href="http://www.TariqAziz.com/sniffit">Tariq Aziz – Words for describing grape aromas</todo_item>)
        It can be worth assessing five or six grapes from different locations on the vine for a fuller picture of its productive profile
