## Access Policies File
##
## This file is dynamically loaded by Wookie and configures
## access policies for the proxy service, including both
## whitelist (global) and widget-specific access policies
##
## Note that when new widgets are added to Wookie their
## access policy requests are automatically added to this
## file.
## 
##
## The format of entries is widget-uri origin directive
## The widget-uri and origin may be a wildcard (*). To enable
## subdomains, use a wildcard as the first element of the
## origin host, e.g. http://*.apache.org
##
## The default (implicit) policy is to deny all origins for all widgets
##
## Example:
##
## * http://127.0.0.1 ALLOW
## http\://www.getwookie.org/widgets/weather http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk ALLOW
## http\://www.getwookie.org/widgets/rss * ALLOW
##
## This set of policies would allow access to 127.0.0.1 for all 
## widgets, while the "weather" widget would be allowed to access 
## URLs from  http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk, and the RSS widget could 
## access any URL from any origin.
##
## Note that it is necessary to escape the ":" character with a "\"

* http://127.0.0.1 ALLOW
* http://localhost:8080 ALLOW
* http://*.apache.org ALLOW
