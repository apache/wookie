This widget template provides an interface for displaying a list of items coupled with an interface for searching and filtering those items.

It is assumed that the results are retrieved from a remote server in XML format.

At this time the location of that remote server is hard coded, however, it is easy to make it 
parameterized and thus make this template more generally useful.

* Customizing

This section describes how the template can be customised.

** Results list

The initial results list is generated by retrieving and XML document from the URL defined by
browse.index.url. This document is then transformed into HTML using "index2html.xsl"

** Result detail

When an item is expanded an ajax request is made to retrieve the details of the item in question. 
The XML returned is then transformed using XSLT to provide the HTML content for the item expanded.

The XSLT is currently found in detail2html.xsl. To change the layout of the detail section your 
widget should provide its own detail2html.xsl file.
