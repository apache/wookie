This widget template provides an interface for displaying a list of items coupled with an 
interface for searching and filtering those items. It is assumed that a suitable REST API
is available for retrieving search results in XML format.

[NOTE: the XML restriction is relatively easy to work around if your REST API returns another
format such as JSON. Join us on the dev mailing list and we'll help you work it out]

* Customizing

This section describes how the template can be customised.

** Results list

The initial results list is generated by retrieving and XML document from the URL defined by
"browse.index.url". This document is then transformed into HTML using a stylesheet defined
in "browse.index.xsl.url" which degaults to "index2html.xsl".

If a search had been performed in the form provided then the results are retrieved from the 
URL defined by "browse.search.url". Note that the variable "query" defines the search string
entered by the user.

The results are displayed in an accordion control.

** Result detail

When an item is expanded an ajax request is made to retrieve the details of the item in question.
The URL used is defined by "browse.get.detail.url", you can use the variable "itemId" as the
identifier for this item.
 
The XML returned is then transformed using XSLT to provide the HTML content that will be inserted
into the expanded control. The location of the XSLT file is defined by "browse.detail.xsl.url" and
defaults to "detail2html.xsl"
