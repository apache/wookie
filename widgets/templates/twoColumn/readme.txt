This is a simple template that provides a two column layout.

content_primary.html will be the main body, by default this will be
rendered on the right of the page.

content_secondary.html will commonly be used for navigation or sidebar
content. By default it is rendered either to the left or right (see
below) of the screeen or, where the screen is too narrow the secondary
content will appear above the primary. Any collapsible items in this
area will be expanded or collpsed as appropriate for the screen
dimensions.

The positions of the secondary and primary content on a wide screen
are controlled by the twoColumn.primary.position and
twoColumn.secdonary.position
