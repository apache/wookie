    <p>This workflow searches for genes which reside in a QTL
      (Quantitative Trait Loci) region in the mouse, Mus musculus. The
      workflow requires an input of: a chromosome name or number; a
      QTL start base pair position; QTL end base pair position. Data
      is then extracted from BioMart to annotate each of the genes
      found in this region. The Entrez and UniProt identifiers are
      then sent to KEGG to obtain KEGG gene identifiers. The KEGG gene
      identifiers are then used to searcg for pathways in the KEGG
      pathway database.</p>
