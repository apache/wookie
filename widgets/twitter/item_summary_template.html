<!--

The template used for item summaries, representing a single record but before
the item detail has been retrieved. We override this to provide all the info in the summary
and not the detail template - this is because the Twitter API is rate limited, and we can
populate the whole thing directly in one call.

Note the OnClick event handler that triggers a search for the user by their screen_name. This
is missing quotes as these are added at some point in the processing of the parameter - if you
include a quote or an escape character then between Ant and JQuery something will go wrong :(
Still, it works as is)
