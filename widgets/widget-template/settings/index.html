			  <p>This widget was built using the "settings" template from Apache Wookie (Incubating).</p>
			 
			  <p>It demonstrates settings handling in a widget using
			     <a href="http://diveintohtml5.org/forms.html">HTML5 forms</a>.
			     The settings form is auto generated in the 
			     settingsService.getsettingDefinitions(group) method.
			     To create your own settings simply edit this method.
			     If your widget needs a large number of different settings you can
			     group settings together. Simply pass in the required group parameter to
			     retrieve the desired group of settings.</p>
			     
			   <p>Groups can be used to describe related sets of settings. When the
		          settings page is requested the user will be presented with a
		          list of links to individual settings pages for each group. If
		          no groups are defined then all settings will be displayed on a 
		          single settings page. Groups are defined in the 
		          <code>SettingsService.getGroups()</code> method.</p>
			   
			   <p>To view the settings page click the widget icon 
			     in the top left of the header, or call the 
			     <a href="javascript:Controller.showSettings()">Controller.showSettings()</a>
			     method. If you are using groups and you want to create a link directly to 
			     a specific group of settings pass the group name as a parameter to the 
			     <a href="javascript:Controller.showSettings('contact')">Controller.showSettings("contact")</a>
			     method.</p>
