# New and Noteworthy: 0.11.0

## Backend refactoring

There were significant backend changes in this revision removing a lot of redundancy in the core model APIs, 
particularly between the parser and server modules.

## GetHost() for shared widgets

Widgets using the Wave feature can now use getHost() and getHosts() to get participants in the Host role.
 
You can also create Participants with roles using the REST API and the Connector; any participant with a
role of "host" will be automatically made available through getHost() and getHosts() calls in the widget.
