# New and Noteworthy: 0.9.2

FIXME Write some documentation for these new features

## oAuth Support

## New Widget Templating System

## Running Wookie on a USB Stick

## New proxy policy management

Rather than manage separate "Whitelist" and "Access Request" lists using the web interface, in 0.9.2
we've introduced a much simpler "policies" file that can be edited in a text editor. Changes to the file
are updated live in the server. The policies file itself contains more detailed documentation, and can
be found in src/policies or WEB-INF/classes/policies on a running server. Policies can still be edited
using the web interface, and a REST API endpoint can be found at /wookie/policies.
