# New and Noteworthy: 0.12.0

## W3C XML Digital Signatures for Widgets specification implemented

W3C XML Digital Signatures for Widgets specifies how both authors and distributors of widgets can 
digitally sign a Widget package.  This means that an organisation can choose to automatically install  
and update widgets that carry recognised signatures - for example from a reputable online widget store 
(distributor) or from an approved widget author rather than require administrative intervention to approve 
them.
 
See http://dev.w3.org/2006/waf/widgets-digsig/ for more information on the specification.

Thanks to Pushpalanka Jayawardhana for this new feature 

## Wookie can broadcast a widget import message 

Using Wookies property file, you can set a flag and URL endpoint to allow Wookie
to POST a message to indicate that it has imported a new widget.  This is useful  
in situations where a container application also wants to import these widgets.
 
## W3C package Validator REST service

Wookie can be configured to validate W3C Widget packages.  This is different behaviour
from importing a package into Wookie, as in this case (if enabled) anyone can validate
a package.  The package is not imported into Wookie and its resources are all removed after
parsing.  This service provide a way for users to check if a package is valid or not and
exposes the W3C Parser module as a service.
