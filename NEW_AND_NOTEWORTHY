# New and Noteworthy: 0.9.2

## New oAuth 2.0 Feature

Wookie widgets can now use oAuth 2.0 to connect to remote services. There is a "Facebook Friend" demo 
widget in scratchpad/widgets to try out - uncomment include.scratchpad.widgets in your build.properties 
file to try it out.

## New Widget Templating System

A new templating system is available for creating widgets, enabling widgets to have a common look-and-feel
or to reuse functionality; you can edit  the template and all widgets based on it can be regenerated with 
the changes. Documentation and examples of both templates and widgets created from them can be found in 
widgets/templates

## New proxy policy management

Rather than manage separate "Whitelist" and "Access Request" lists using the web interface, in 0.9.2
we've introduced a much simpler "policies" file that can be edited in a text editor. Changes to the file
are updated live in the server. The policies file itself contains more detailed documentation, and can
be found in src/policies or WEB-INF/classes/policies on a running server. Policies can still be edited
using the web interface, and a REST API endpoint can be found at /wookie/policies.
