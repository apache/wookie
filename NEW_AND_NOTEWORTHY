# New and Noteworthy: 1.0.0

## Full version 1.0.0 release

This version of wookie is considered mature and stable enough to be known as version 1.0.0, 
rather than the next intended version (0.16.0). This release contains some minor improvements
and bug fixes, but more importantly now marks version 1.* releases as separate to the main
work being developed in the main trunk. (now known as version 2.*)
 
## Fork in Wookie

The code-base for versions 1.* are now contained in a separate branch of the 
subversion repository.  This branch will be still maintained and releases made periodically
to address bugs and other various issues.
 
## Minor Improvements for 1.0.0

A number of bug fixes and improvements have been made concerning wookie running under
Wildfire, JBoss and WebSphere platforms.
