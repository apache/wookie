This is a Redis implementation of the Wookie SPI

To use it, place a file called org.apache.wookie.services.PreferencesService in META-INF/services of swookie-server. 

This file should just contain the line:

org.apache.wookie.services.redis.RedisPreferencesService

This will make wookie-server start up using the Redis preferences implemetnation instead of the default in-memory preferences store.
