Discussion
==========

We do the vote on the private mailing list to enable a frank discussion.

Start a separate Vote thread for each new person. This makes it much
easier to review the mail archives.

In most cases, we will be inviting people to go straight from developer
to PPMC member. However, there may be extraordinary cases where we want
limited work-related commit access. This will be resolved during the vote
discussion. http://forrest.apache.org/guidelines.html#elect (yes, I know
this is not the Wookie project, we need to create our own guidelines)

We need to be sure that they are committed people that we can work with.
They will be our peers. We will have already observed that they are
committed to the project and graceful toward users and other developers.

Don't wait too long before proposing and don't be too hasty. There is a
trade-off and something about timeliness. A point is reached where it
becomes obvious that we should invite them. This encourages them and keeps
them enthusiastic. If we leave it too long, then we risk them becoming
disillusioned.

On the PPMC list we can each say exactly what we feel about each person,
with no holds barred. Keep the discussion concise. The praise part can
be done later in public.

See the end of this document for some guidelines to help you to assess a
candidate.

Let the Vote thread run for one week.
A positive result is achieved by Consensus Approval
http://forrest.apache.org/guidelines.html#approvals
i.e. at least 3 +1 votes and no vetoes.
Any veto must be accompanied by reasoning and be prepared to defend it.
Other members can attempt to encourage them to change.

New PPMC members can be either quiet or active as they choose. If we find
that certain people lapse and don't ever contribute, then we can take steps
to retire them.

After a positive result, we give them a chance to decline in private.
They can post a reply to the PPMC mailing list.

After we reach a decision on the PPMC list, and after the steps above,
we will announce it on the dev list. We can then each follow up with
our praise in public.

There are template emails for each stage of the process at ./templates/
These may need tweaks for each case. Also remember that these templates
are just a guide, especially the announcement one.

Guidelines for assessing candidates
-----------------------------------

When voting, you need to make up your own mind, perhaps search mailing lists
and Jira, etc. The following are some tips that we developed on the private@
list. It seems that each time we discuss someone, then new ideas arise about
what we should look for, e.g. private@ archives early July 2006.
Also consider http://forrest.apache.org/committed.html

0) Ability to work co-operatively with peers. Ability to be a mentor.
- How do we evaluate?  By the interactions they have through mail. By how
they respond to criticism. By how they participate in decision-making process.
1) Community - How do we evaluate?  By the interactions they have through mail.
2) Committment - How do we evaluate?  By time, by sticking through tough
issues, by helping on not-so-fun tasks as well.
3) Personal skill/ability - How do we evaluate?  A solid general understanding
of Forrest.  Quality of discussion in mail.  Patches easy to apply with only
a cursory review.
