Subject: invitation to become Wookie committer: Joe Bloggs #####

Hello #####, the Apache Wookie Project Management Committee
would like to invite you to become a Wookie committer and member
of the PMC. We value your contributions and are aware that
you are committed to the project.

Being a committer enables you to more easily make changes and so
not need to go via the patch submission process. This should
enable you to be more productive. Being also a PMC member enables
you to guide the direction of the project.

While this does not mean that you need to participate any more
than you already do, it does tend to make one even more committed.
Hence you will probably find that you spend more time here.

Of course, you can decline and instead remain as a developer,
contributing as you do now.

This personal email is also providing a chance for you to decline
in private. Either way, please let us know in reply only to the
private@wookie.apache.org list. If you agree, then we 
will announce on the dev@ list after the account is established.

Yours,
The Apache Wookie PMC
