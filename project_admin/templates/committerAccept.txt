Welcome. Here are the next steps. After that we will make
an announcement to the wookie-dev list.

You need to send a Contributor License Agreement to the ASF.
Normally you would send an Individual CLA. If you also make
contributions done in work time or using work resources then
see the Corporate CLA. Ask us if you have any issues.
http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas

You need to choose a preferred ASF user name and alternatives.
In order to ensure it is available you can view a list of taken ids at
http://www.apache.org/~jim/committers.html

Please notify us when you have submitted the CLA and by what means 
you did so. This will enable us to monitor its progress.

We will arrange for your Apache user account when the CLA has 
been recorded.

After that is done, please make followup replies to the wookie-dev list.
We generally discuss everything there and keep this wookie-private@ list
for occasional matters which must be private.

The developer section of the website describes the roles
and provides other resources:
http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html
http://www.apache.org/dev/

The incubator also has some useful information for new committers
in incubating projects:
http://incubator.apache.org/guides/committer.html
http://incubator.apache.org/guides/ppmc.html

In the absence of our own guidelines document we are currently 
using those developed at Apache Forrest:
http://forrest.apache.org/guidelines.html

Yours,
The Apache Wookie PPMC
