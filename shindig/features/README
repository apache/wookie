Shindig Features README

The files in the folders /features/core and /features/setprefs replace the Shindig preference handling
stubs with an interface to the Widget.preferences HTML 5 object implemented in Wookie.

In Core:
	- prefs.js has been altered to make the W3C Widget calls
	- wookie-xxxxx.js has been added
	- features.xml has had the wookie-xxxx.js libs included

In SetPrefs
	- setprefs.js the rpc calls have been removed
	
Replace or merge these files with the standard Shindig features files to add W3C widget persistence

A ready-built Shindig-features jar accompanies these source files.
