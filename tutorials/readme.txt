This folder contains some tutorials to help you get started with Wookie and W3C Widgets. Most of the tutorials are
s5  presentations packaged as widgets. However, since they don't use any of the features of Wookie you can load
the index.html page of each widget directly in the browser and they will work.

Naturally you can deploy them onto a running Wookie server like any other widget.
