This build is meant to get a user started with the process of deploying
Wookie under an existing application container and as such Wookie is made available in
WAR format. This particular download is oriented towards deploying Wookie under a Tomcat
instance running with Mysql.  Deploying against other containers and database environments
should be also possible by following the instructions below.

Generic instructions for deployment
===================================
In order to deploy Wookie onto your application server, you must...

(1) Install a suitable database driver for Wookie on your server (if you haven't already)
(2) Create a user with the group/rolename as "widgetadmin" on your server installation
	-  and give this user the credentials username=java password=java
(3) Create a database called 'widgetDB' in your database
(4) Create a user 'java' with the password 'java' in your database and give this user suitable 
	permissions on the above database	
(5) Run one of the sql scripts found under the scripts folder to create the Wookie database structure
(6) Create/configure a context.xml file under your server for Wookie
(7) Copy the wookie.war to your webapps or deploy directory
(8) Start your server
(9) Open your browser and goto 'http://YOURSERVERADDRESS:8080/wookie' (i.e. http://localhost:8080/wookie)

The following text describes this process specifically for Tomcat and Mysql...


Running Wookie with Tomcat and MySQL manual configuration
=========================================================

(1) Obtain a JDBC driver jar file for the database.
	(for example the mysql driver can be downloaded from 
	http://www.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)
	The downloaded zip file should contain a jar file, something similar to 
	mysql-connector-java-5.1.*-bin.jar
	
(2) Place the mysql-connector-java-5.1.*-bin.jar file into tomcats lib folder 
	so it is founnd on the classpath at runtime
	(for example in tomcat 5.5.* place this file into /tomcat-root/common/lib)
	(for example in tomcat 6.0.* place this file into /tomcat-root/lib)

(3) You will need to create a user with the role "widgetadmin" in your tomcat installation. 
	For example, add the following line to the file /tomcat-root/conf/tomcat-users.xml:

	<role rolename="widgetadmin"/><user username="java" password="java" roles="widgetadmin"/>
	
(4) Create a database in mysql called 'widgetdb'. 

(5) Create a user in mysql 'java' with the password 'java' and give them suitable permisions 
	on the widgetDB

(6) Copy the file wookie.xml to your tomcat-root/conf/catalina/servername folder	
	(for example in tomcat 5.5.* & 6.0.* place this file into /tomcat-root/conf/Catalina/localhost)

(7) Locate the 'mysql-wookie-schema.sql' file found under 'scripts' and run this to populate the 
	'widgetDB' database you created
	- NOTE: the first time you run this script, you may have to remove the drop foreign key statements 
	found at the top of the script
	
	i.e. the statements that look similar to these..
	
	ALTER TABLE tablename
    DROP FOREIGN KEY FKWidgetTablename;
	
	... as the first time they won't exist.
	
(8) Copy the 'wookie.war' file to your deployment folder '/tomcat-root/webapps'

(9) Start your server

(10) Open your browser and goto 'http://YOURSERVERADDRESS:8080/wookie' (i.e. http://localhost:8080/wookie)
